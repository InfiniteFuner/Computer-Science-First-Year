                These are all the projects from my first year of Computer Science. Most of these projects were done in class and using Java (2024). 
              These were done last year, but ironically enough, done after I took more advanced classes. An example of a project in this repository is the
                          Complex Number, where you can input a complex number and get the real and the imaginary part of the number.
